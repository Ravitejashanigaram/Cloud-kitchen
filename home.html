                    In the present scenario the cloud kitchen owners face many problems mainly marketing and selling their products online besides they also have lack of investment,lack of machineries which can speedup the process of cooking and makes the cook to get less strained. There is no guidance to the owners or cooks about how to start their business and how to grow it in this fast growing world as there may be no knowledge about the social media platforms or the lack of knowledge in adapting the new generation technology and threiving through old techniques and procedures. The owners may be most of the housewifes who stay at home and are really good at cooking and want to start their business in cooking but they lack investments as they cannot afford all the requirements that are needed to make food ,so they limit their preparations and settle with less income. They won't be able to invest in huge machineries which make their work easy and prepares food in less as they are very costly to purchase.

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Disadvantages</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of Knowledge in market requirements and failing in fullfilling them</li>
                    <li>Not able to make investments on new machinaries that could help in preparing the food in less time</li>
                    <li>As the owners of these cloud kitchens are hiusewifes and they lack in the knowledge in marketing and advertising about their products in the social media platforms</li>
                    <li>The customers reach will be less as they won't known by more number of people</li>
                    <li>Income will be moderate as they can demand more as it will make time to prepare food and keep the customers waiting for more time</li>
                </ul>

                    So to overcome all these disadvantages we propose a new portal named Vola. In vola we have three modules  namely admin ,manager and the cook. The admin will monitor all the activities that are being carried out inside the portal. The main work here will be done by manger who is responsible for bringing the cloud kitchens to come and register in our portal. In our portal we will provide the machineries that are required to prepare food and which will reduce the time required to prepare food. Our portal will handle all the technical issues and marketing strategies. We will provide all the requirements that are essential for making the food ready for delivery in less time that is  actually required to  do that dish. the cook or chef has to just prepare food and send for delivery. they can earn whilw we invest in their work which increses their income as well as save their time and strength.
